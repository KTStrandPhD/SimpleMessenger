Dynon Coding Project - Kyle Strand

For this project we would like you to demonstrate an IPC methodology. You are free to choose how you do it as long as it abides by the requirements below.

	Language: C and/or C++
	Must compile and run on Ubuntu 22.04.
	Must pass the following data structure through the IPC process.
	{
		int,
		float,
		string data (C or C++ formatted your choice)
		enum { type1, type2, type3 }
	}
	The receiving side should print out at minimum 10 different versions of the structure above in the following format:
		int: {value}, float: {value}, string: {value}, enum {human readable, e.g type1}    -> Does this mean just give 10 inputs?
	Code should be in a git repository so we can pull it and compile it for testing.

There is no time limit on this project. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. We look forward to evaluating your project.
